# Rate Limiter

This library allows you to decorate a function with a rate limiter. This project's structure borrows heavily from
[Resilicience4clj][resilience4clj]. Hopefully it will be merged there soon :)

[![Clojars][clojars-badge]][clojars]

## Getting Started

Add `lurodrigo/ratelimiter` as a dependency to your
`deps.edn` file:

``` clojure
lurodrigo/ratelimiter {:mvn/version "0.1.3"}
```

If you are using `lein` instead, add it as a dependency to your
`project.clj` file:

``` clojure
[lurodrigo/ratelimiter "0.1.3"]
```

Require the library:

``` clojure
(require '[ratelimiter.core :as r])
```

Then create a rate limiter calling the function `create`:

``` clojure
(def rate-limiter (create "my-ratelimiter" {:limit-for-period     3
                                            :limit-refresh-period 3000
                                            :timeout-duration     4000}))
```

Now you can decorate any function you have with the rate limiter you just
defined.

```clojure
(defn my-print
  [msg]
  (println (str "At " (java.time.LocalDateTime/now) ": " msg "\n")))

(def dprint (decorate my-print rate-limiter))
```

According to the [upstream docs][upstream-docs]:

> Resilience4j provides a RateLimiter which splits all nanoseconds from the
> start of epoch into cycles. Each cycle has a duration configured by 
> `RateLimiterConfig.limitRefreshPeriod`. At the start of each cycle, 
> the RateLimiter sets the number of active permissions to `RateLimiterConfig.limitForPeriod`.
>

We can test that behavior with the following code:

```clojure
(doseq [x ["A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I"]]
  (dprint x))
```

The first three letters should be printed at almost the same time, immediately. 
The next three should be printed between 0 and 3 seconds after that. 
Then, after 3 more seconds, the final three letters will be printed. Let's look at the output:

```
At 2020-07-28T21:16:52.475560: A

At 2020-07-28T21:16:52.476211: B

At 2020-07-28T21:16:52.476757: C

At 2020-07-28T21:16:54.661593: D

At 2020-07-28T21:16:54.662235: E

At 2020-07-28T21:16:54.662693: F

At 2020-07-28T21:16:57.661574: G

At 2020-07-28T21:16:57.662249: H

At 2020-07-28T21:16:57.662785: I
```

Just as expected! Now, let's try to print all nine letters at the same time:

```clojure
(import io.github.resilience4j.ratelimiter.RequestNotPermitted)

(doseq [x ["A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I"]]
  (future
    (try
      (dprint x)
      (catch RequestNotPermitted e
      (my-print (.getMessage e))))))
```

What is the expected behavior? Well, some three letters will be printed immediately. Then, after some time between
0 and 3 seconds, another three letters will be printed. Finally, ~4 seconds after the code was sent for evaluation,
`RequestNotPermitted` will be sent for the last three letters. Let's check:

```

```


## Rate Limiter Settings

When creating a rate limiter, you can fine tune three of its settings:

1. `:limit-for-period` - The number of permissions available during one limit refresh period. Default is 50.
2. `:limit-refresh-period` - The period of a limit refresh. After each period the rate limiter sets its permissions
 count back to the limit-for-period value. Default is 0.0005 ms (500 ns).
3. `:timeout-duration` - The default wait time a thread waits for a permission. Default value is 5000 (ms). 

These three options can be sent to `create` as a map. In the following
example, any function decorated with `rate-limiter` will be attempted for 10
times with in 300ms intervals.

``` clojure
(def rate-limiter (r/create "my-rate-limiter" {:limit-for-period 10
                                               :limit-refresh-period 10000}))
```

The function `config` returns the configuration of a rate-limiter in case
you need to inspect it. Example:

``` clojure
(r/config rate-limiter)
=> {:limit-refresh-period #object[java.time.Duration 0x5fbf7654 "PT10S"],
    :limit-for-period 10,
    :timeout-duration #object[java.time.Duration 0x6e0113dc "PT5S"]}
```

Using `change`, it's possible to change some of the rate limiter's configs after its
creation. Currently, it's possible to change `limit-for-period` and `timeout-duration`.

```clojure
(r/change rate-limiter {:limit-for-period 20})
```

## Metrics

The function `metrics` returns a map with the rate limiter's metrics:

``` clojure
(r/metrics rate-limiter)

=> {:available-permissions 10, 
    :number-of-waiting-threads 0}
```

The nodes should be self-explanatory.
